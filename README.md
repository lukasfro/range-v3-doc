# range-v3 Documentation

DISCLAIMER: This document is a work in progress. I aim to finish a first release in the next few weeks. Until then, this document might contain some minor errors as not all code examples have not yet been extensively tested.

This is the repository for [my (inofficial) documentation](https://lukasfro.github.io/range-v3-doc/) of the [range-v3 library](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3).

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or directly create a pull request.
